### Article 1
-  Article name.
 - DHS Admits Facial Recognition Photos Were Hacked, Released on Dark Web

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7jzbb/dhs-admits-facial-recognition-photos-were-hacked-released-on-dark-web

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Data collected by homeland security for use in facial recognition being leaked onto the deep web.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern I see is the fact that Homeland security only recently admited to the information leak so the people who had their data leaked didn't have time to do anything to protect themselves against people who may of used the info for something malicous.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data being manipulated is facial recognition information, license plate information, and care information.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The analysis techonology was facial recognition used to detect and identify people crossing into America through it's borders.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The people who's data was leaked stand to lose anything since the information leaked could cause indentity fraud or anything else. However, i'm sure the hackers are happy and may gain something from the information they gained.


### Article 2
-  Article name.
 - Privacy organisations raise concerns over new Test and Trace data collection programme

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://tech.newstatesman.com/security/privacy-organisations-raise-concerns-over-new-test-and-trace-data-collection-programme

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - New legislation being used to track people's locations in order to maintain and understand where covid-19 may have been spread to and who may have been infected.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - A mass recording of people's movements without proper safe guarding of the data.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Locational data such as places eaten at, home locations, etc.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - New legislation is being required for people to download an app that tracks their locations to track the spread of covid-19. It would also hold personal contact information. Without the app installed, their would be restrictions on the places you could go and be refused service at mutiple locations such as stores. There is currently no information on how this data would be safe-guarded from leaks.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The people who are required to use the app stand to lose their privacy since the data could be leaked by someone and then all the places they go to or stay at are free for anyone to know about. The only gain here is that it would make tracking the spread of covid-19 easier to prevent outbreaks. This gain would help both the people and the government.
